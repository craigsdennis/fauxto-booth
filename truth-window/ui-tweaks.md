# Fauxto Booth Session Log

## User Request (verbatim)
Nice let's create a new truth-window called ui-tweaks

## What I Delivered
- Captured UI adjustments such as the Selfie Station rebrand and mirrored camera view in a dedicated log for future reference.
- Added an SMS invite link on the Selfie Station header so guests can text friends the phone capture URL with a single tap.
