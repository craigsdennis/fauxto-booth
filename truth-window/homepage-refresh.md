# Fauxto Booth Session Log

## User Request (verbatim)
This is a photo booth app called "Fauxto Booth". What is gonna happen is you can create virtual photo booths and people will be able to find the booth, upload a photo, and we will generate a photo as if they are together. There are going to be multiple pages and the home page will let you create a booth. The starts of it is there but there is a demo form in App.tsx. Let's update that feel free to change the styling

## What I Delivered
- Rebuilt the landing hero and form to spotlight booth creation with modern gradients and depth cues so new users immediately understand the product.
- Wired the form to the hub agent with real validation, pending states, and success/error messaging plus auto-reset after submission.
- Added companion sections for recent booths and a "How it works" primer so hosts see immediate feedback and onboarding guidance.
